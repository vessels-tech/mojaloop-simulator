At the time of writing, this directory contains ephemeral (read: unimportant) scripts for testing
functionality during development. It is expected that as unit testing is implemented these scripts
will become less and less useful. If you're reading this, consider deleting this directory (ask
forgiveness, rather than permission, everything is in version control anyway).
